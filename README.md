Mathematical Studies
====================

This repository serves to collect various materials gathered throughout math
studies, including course transcripts as well as some exercise solutions.

Download transcripts as pdf
---------------------------

Most transcripts are being compiled hourly and can be downloaded as pdf's at:

  http://www.stud.mathematik.uni-stuttgart.de/~hilbsn/ts/


Compiling transcripts yourself
------------------------------

In most directories there should be a Makefile which handles compilation for
you.
So be sure to have a *recent* LaTeX distribution as well as preferrably LatexMk
installed and run

    make

in the directory of your choice.
You can configure the paper size to a5 by running `make config-a5` or generate
a booklet using `make book-a5-booklet`.

Helping out
-----------

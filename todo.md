# General ToDo-List

## Common

- Figure out a good way for referencing (or just marking) exercises with `\Exercise` (index too?)
- Revise `\coursetimestamp{}{}{}` syntax and usage
- What about `\fixme` notation, showing on the margin, or even with an index?
- Reference \ref{4.7}[b] for subitems

## Titlepage

- Include timestamps for last change date
- Include recent git history (filtered for current course)

## Exercise Class

- rewrite `myexercise` class
- use xtemplate?

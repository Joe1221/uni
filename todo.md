# General ToDo-List

## Common

- Find a solution for `:=` colon not being centered (define `:` as active char?), but not breaking anything else
- Figure out a good way for referencing (or just marking) exercises with `\Exercise` (index too?)
- Revise `\coursetimestamp{}{}{}` syntax and usage
- What about `\fixme` notation, showing on the margin, or even with an index?
- Reference `\ref{4.7}[b]` for subitems

### Titlepage

- Include timestamps for last change date
- Include recent git history (filtered for current course)

### Index

- Figure out dotfill style with xindy

## Exercise Class

- rewrite `myexercise` class
- use xtemplate?
